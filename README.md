Our mission is to conduct sentiment analysis on the most popular spotify genre's playlist's lyrics. In this analysis, we will present frequent vocabulary, popularity correlations, and sentiment analysis of the lyrics used to determine the positivity level of each genre (Pop, Rock, Country, Metal, and Rap). This analysis will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern music's sentiment.
