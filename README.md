# datamining-final-project

Team Lead: Alex Koener

Team Members: Efrain Ramos, Victoria Garcia, Ryan Hermann, and Darius Cuthbert.

Our mission is to conduct sentiment analysis on the most popular spotify genre's playlist's lyrics. In this analysis, we will present frequent vocabulary, popularity correlations, and sentiment analysis of the lyrics used to determine the positivity level of each genre (Pop, Rock, Country, Metal, and Rap). This analysis will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern music's sentiment.

Within the "Submission" folder, you will find the file "final_markdown.html" which is the completed project results and code. You will also find the file "Final-Presentaion.mp4" which is our final video presentation.
