# datamining-final-project

Our mission is to conduct sentiment analysis on the most popular spotify genre's playlist's lyrics. In this analysis, we will present frequent vocabulary, popularity correlations, and sentiment analysis of the lyrics used to determine the positivity level of each genre (Pop, Rock, Country, Metal, and Rap). This analysis will hopefully lead to a better understanding of modern music's sentiment.


I encourage you to learn "git" because it will be a great tool to use in the future. Below is an intro youtube video and should be plenty of info to use Git properly within this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE&list=PLJJJ0pJgkuiFwLFKPyAVOeAzPrsJXGxL9

Alternatively, here is a link to an article that shows how to use Git and GitHub desktop to clone and share the project.
